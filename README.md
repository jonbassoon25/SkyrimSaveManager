Notes:
    Because Tod designed his game to be perfect, any saves created in (modded) zones with underscores in their name
    will not work and will break any subsequent saves.
    This mod was not designed to work with these saves as Tod wouldn't let them work anyways.
    To fix this issue, I recommend using SSEEdit Script - Fix Oldrim Bad WRLD and CELL EDID Names: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148894
